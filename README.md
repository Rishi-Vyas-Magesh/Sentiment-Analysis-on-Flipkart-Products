# Sentiment-Analysis-on-  Any Flipkart-Products

This is a project I undertook beacuse of my liking to Sentiment Analysis. This is a LEXICON based approach To be specific "VADER" lexicon as it is a more sophisticated and good currently trending lexicon which covers, slang, emoticons etc by assigning everything aan intensity score between -4 to +4.

I perfected a code with AI help to be able to use SELENIUM + Chromedriver to automate and simulate Chrome Browsing and scrape Reviews for any product in Flipkart by understaning where Reviews are on the page by visiting its "Inspect"(Right click on Flipkart) and see where exaclty the key/tag is.

We need to feed the URL of any flipkart product after visiting it and clicking on "Show all Reviews"--That page which opens should be the input URL.
It asks the user for the product URL and the nUmber of reviews to be scraped for analysis.

Then the magic happens in my code. Do explore it! and find out.
